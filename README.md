# EECE2140_Final_Project
For the final project of EECE2140 Computing Fundamentals for Engineers, by Gabriel Lau and Juan Ipina. <br>
The python file was designed by both Gabriel Lau and Juan Ipina and can handle turning a string into a boolean truth table. It also displays the equation given in a semi-simplified form, as well as a karnaugh map for the equation.<br>
The Matlab file was designed entirely by Juan Ipina, and uses the python file to take in a designated string and display the truth table and a karnaugh map for the equation. It can also take in a truth table to complete the same equations. <br>
Variable names are allowed to occur multiple times, and can be longer than 1 letter. However, certain words such as "as" or "and" or "not" are not allowed as variable names because it will interfere with python's code.
